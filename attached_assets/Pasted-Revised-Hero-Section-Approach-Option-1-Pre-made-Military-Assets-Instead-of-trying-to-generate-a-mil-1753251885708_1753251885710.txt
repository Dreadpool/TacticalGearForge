Revised Hero Section Approach
Option 1: Pre-made Military Assets
Instead of trying to generate a military scene from scratch, we should use:
Asset Libraries to Import:

Sketchfab - Military base models, tactical gear 3D models
Polyhaven - HDRIs of industrial/military environments
Quixel Megascans - Concrete textures, metal surfaces, military props
CGTrader - Specific military vehicle models
TextureCan - Camouflage patterns, tactical fabric textures

Option 2: Video Background with WebGL Overlay
More reliable approach for Replit:
Use a high-quality military training video as background with:
- CSS filters for desaturation/military tone
- WebGL particle overlay for dust/smoke
- 3D product floating on top
- UI elements with glassmorphism
Revised Prompt 2: Realistic Military Hero
Create a tactical gear hero section using video background and WebGL overlays:

VIDEO BACKGROUND:
1. Add looping video of military training ground/shooting range
2. Apply CSS filters:
   - filter: contrast(1.2) brightness(0.8) sepia(0.2)
   - Dark vignette overlay
   - Scan lines effect

WEBGL OVERLAY ELEMENTS:
1. Floating tactical vest (import GLTF model):
   - Use pre-made model from Sketchfab
   - Simple rotation animation
   - Rim lighting for emphasis
   - Shadow on ground plane

2. Particle system:
   - Dust motes floating (not colorful Mars dust!)
   - Use gray/brown colors only
   - Subtle movement, not distracting

3. HUD ELEMENTS:
   - Crosshair that tracks mouse
   - Corner brackets framing the scene
   - Data readouts with military stats
   - Green phosphor text overlays

TEXTURES TO IMPORT:
- Military concrete: https://polyhaven.com/a/concrete_wall_004
- Metal grating: https://polyhaven.com/a/metal_grate_rusty
- Tactical fabric: Search "cordura texture" on TextureCan

LIGHTING:
- Harsh directional light (sun)
- Subtle green accent lights
- No colorful/fantasy lighting

The scene should feel like a military base, NOT sci-fi.
Alternative Approach: 2.5D Parallax
If full 3D proves too challenging:
Create a 2.5D parallax military scene using layered images:

LAYERS (back to front):
1. Military base background photo
2. Chain-link fence (PNG with transparency)
3. Humvee/tactical vehicle silhouette
4. Smoke/dust particles (WebGL)
5. Hero product (3D model or high-quality photo)
6. UI overlay with tactical graphics

Each layer moves at different speeds on mouse move for depth.
This approach guarantees a military look while keeping performance high.
Pre-made Resources to Use:
Military UI Kits:

"Military HUD Elements" on GraphicRiver
"Tactical Interface Kit" on UI8
"Military Grade UI" on Creative Market

Color References:
Instead of bright greens, use:

Olive Drab: #3C341F
Ranger Green: #425439
Coyote Brown: #81613C
FDE (Flat Dark Earth): #C8A882
Wolf Gray: #4A4E54

Typography:

Import "Bebas Neue" or "Oswald" for headers
"Share Tech Mono" for terminal text
"Rajdhani" for tactical UI elements

Simplified Hero Prompt for Replit:
Create a military hero section that actually looks tactical:

1. BACKGROUND:
   - Use a dark, blurred image of military gear/base
   - Add CSS: background-image with dark overlay
   - No gradients or abstract shapes

2. MAIN CONTENT:
   - Large "TACTICAL GEAR" text in military stencil font
   - Subtitle in typewriter effect
   - High-quality product image (not 3D if too complex)
   - Simple parallax on scroll

3. MILITARY DETAILS:
   - Corner brackets like weapon sights
   - Subtle scan line animation
   - Green accent color (#00FF41) used sparingly
   - Hexagon pattern overlay (subtle)

4. INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS:
   - "BROWSE GEAR" button styled like military equipment tag
   - Mouse follower crosshair (simple, not distracting)
   - Glitch effect on hover

Keep it dark, gritty, and tactical - not sci-fi or gaming.
The key is using real military imagery/textures as a base rather than trying to generate them programmatically.
